# Overview

Welcome to **Building Analytics Applications with Cube**! This 3-hour hands-on workshop will teach you how to build modern analytics applications using a Cube Semantic Layer.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this workshop, you'll understand Cube's four core pillars and how they work together to create scalable analytics applications:

1. **Data Modeling** - Define metrics, dimensions, and business logic
2. **Access Control** - Secure your data with row-level security and column-level masking
3. **Caching** - Optimize performance with pre-aggregations  
4. **APIs** - Access data through multiple interface options

You'll also build a complete React dashboard that visualizes TPCH e-commerce data and explore Cube's D3 Agentic Analytics platform for natural language querying.

## Our Story: Technical Parts Commerce Hub

Throughout this workshop, we'll work with **Technical Parts Commerce Hub (TPCH)**, a fictional B2B e-commerce company that sells industrial parts and components. They need analytics to understand:

- Sales performance across regions
- Customer behavior and segmentation  
- Product popularity and inventory optimization
- Order fulfillment efficiency

We'll use the industry-standard TPC-H dataset to build realistic analytics that any e-commerce business would need.
